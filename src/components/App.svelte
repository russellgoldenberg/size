  <h1>academiaâ€™s curious fixation with this platitudinous phallic phrase</h1>

    <summary>why am i looking at this? ðŸ‘€</summary>
    <p>
      i was doing "real" research on google scholar, and a paper grabbed my attention with a very
      dubious usage of "does size matter?" i thought that was strange, so I searched to see if how
      common it was. sure enough, i found over 1,000 results in the past 20 years, most not dealing
      with male anatomy.
